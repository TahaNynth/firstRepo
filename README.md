This is a short report on our 1st end semester project, which was a presentation on the cyber security threat, Buffer overflow attack. A significant portion of the presentation was dedicated to a step-by-step demonstration of a simple stack-based buffer overflow attack. The demo showcased the following steps:
# Overview:
This report provides a concise overview on the topic of mitigating stack-based buffer overflow attacks. The presentation delves into the nature of buffer overflow attacks, their real-world implications, and various strategies to prevent and defend against them.
# Buffer Overflow Attacks: 
The presentation explains what buffer overflow attacks are, how they work, and why they are dangerous. It also provides examples of real-world buffer overflow exploits and their impacts.
# Mitigation Strategies: 
The presentation outlines various mitigation strategies to prevent and defend against buffer overflow attacks, such as secure coding practices, compiler protections, runtime mechanisms, and security tools1.
